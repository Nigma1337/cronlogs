## Cronlogs
Small utility for getting logs fron cronjobs, using [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) for ux

### Installation
Running `go build` will create the cronlogs cli, pog. Ensure [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is installed

If you want to call it via `kubectl cronlogs`, rename it to kubectl-cronlogs and move it somewhere on your $PATH
### TODO

- [x] Use as kubectl plugin
- [] Performance?
